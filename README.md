Some of my personal code for this awesome game

## How it works
`Default.js` contains the code I copy paste in my DEFAULT character file. It will basically load the code from current folder or repo and run it.

## Feature
- Deploy group
- Merchant
  - Back and forth between party and town
  - Sort items

## WIP
- all other functions I have in my game folder are getting added here slowly
- some refactoring to do on Merchant Class and Utils
